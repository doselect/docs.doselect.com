# Webhooks

The webhooks framework notifies you about various actions that have happened related to the resources on your team. You can add a
`webhook_url` in your team settings. Whenever a new event occurs, we will make a `POST` request to this URL with a JSON payload in body.

If you return anything other than an HTTP 2XX status to the webhook POST then weâ€™ll try to deliver the webhook up to 5 times with a backoff.

## Payload

For each webhook delivery on a URL, the `POST` request contains a JSON payload in the body with information about the action.

The `meta` object contains metadata about the current webhook delivery, like the `sender`, `action`, `timestamp` and `delivery_id`.

The `object` attribute contains a contextual object.
