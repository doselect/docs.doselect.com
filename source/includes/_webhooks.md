# Webhooks

The webhooks framework notifies you about various events that have happened related to the resources on your team. You can add a
`webhook_url` in your team settings. Whenever a new event occurs, we will make a `POST` request to this URL with a JSON payload in body.

If you return anything other than a HTTP 200 status to the webhook POST then weâ€™ll try to deliver the webhook up to 5 times with a backoff.

The following events are currently sent:

* Test started by a candidate
* Test submitted by a candidate
