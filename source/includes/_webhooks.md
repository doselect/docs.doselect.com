# Webhooks

The webhooks framework notifies you about various actions that have happened related to the resources on your team. You can add a
`webhook_url` in your team settings. Whenever a new event occurs, we will make a `POST` request to this URL with a JSON payload in body.

If you return anything other than an HTTP 2XX status to the webhook POST then weâ€™ll try to deliver the webhook up to 5 times with a backoff.

**Tip:** You can use a service like [RequestBin](https://requestb.in/) to test webhook delivery.


## Payload

For each webhook delivery on a URL, the `POST` request contains a JSON payload in the body with information about the action.

The `meta` object contains metadata about the current webhook delivery, like the `sender`, `action`, `timestamp` and `delivery_id`.

The `object` attribute contains a contextual object.


> Payload body

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "sender": "test-session",
        "action": "end",
        "timestamp": "2017-10-07T10:41:31.846531+00:00",
        "delivery_id": "441cd01e-d82d-485c-95d8-c8c498417649"
    },
    "object": {
        "report_uri": "https://api.doselect.com/platform/v1/test/k716y/candidates/mibukuyij@storj99.com/report",
        "test_uri": "https://api.doselect.com/platform/v1/test/k716y",
        "email": "mibukuyij@storj99.com",
        "test_slug": "k016y"
    }
}
```

## Webhook Security

In using a webhook, there is a possibility that an attacker might be able to forge webhook notifications which
might result in unwanted actions being taken.

To prevent that, in each webhook delivery from DoSelect, the `POST` request will contain a `DoSelect-Webhook-Signature` header.

For verification, on your server side, you need to generate a [HMAC (hash based message authentication code)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code),
using **SHA256**, with the current request's `delivery_id` as the message and your `API_SECRET` as the key.

The calculated and the request hashes should match, indicating that the message is authentic and was indeed sent by DoSelect.
